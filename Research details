Why develop a prediction model?
•	It helps health insurance companies target members who are vulnerable and initiate protocols to educate, inform and protect these members.
•	This model can be modified to predict other diseases which are both costly and harmful to members.
•	It allows data and analytics to guide our strategies and policies. A health insurance company’s internal medical claim data is one of their most valuable assets.
